# seminar-otree-example
Repository for the seminar "Designing and Implementing Online Survey Experiments (SoSe 2022)". This is the hands-on tutorial part for the seminar which I worked on as a research assistant for Susumu Shikano at the University in Konstanz (Center for Data and Methods). I prepared most of the sessions with help of Fabienne Stein and Kate Hahn-Madole (their contributions can be found in their commits). Each session was covering a topic to introduce the students to the basics of the framework "otree" for survey construction and general knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The goal was to introduce as many different possbilities in the framework and test it with the students instead of making it a perfect survey. This is a repository which will be reused for repetitions of the seminar accompanied by a document I helped write and video tutorial-lectures I prepared and recorded for the different sessions.
